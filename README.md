# Offline RAG AI Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI assistant that works fully offline using FAISS and FLAN-T5. <br>
Done as a part of the course Generative AI and its Applications (UE23CS342BA4)

---

## Features

- Wikipedia-based knowledge retrieval
- FAISS vector similarity search
- Offline LLM using FLAN-T5 (no API required)
- Chat-style UI with left-right message alignment
- Fast and lightweight (CPU-friendly)
- No dependency on external APIs

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) |
| Embeddings | Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) |
| Vector DB | FAISS |
| Language Model | HuggingFace Transformers (`flan-t5-base`) |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Data Source | Wikipedia (via Python library) |

---

## System Architecture

```
User Query
    ↓
FAISS (semantic search)
    ↓
Top-k relevant Wikipedia chunks
    ↓
FLAN-T5 (generate answer)
    ↓
Final Response (UI)
```

---

## How It Works

1. User enters topics (e.g., *Artificial Intelligence*, *Mars*)
2. System retrieves relevant data from Wikipedia
3. Text is split into smaller chunks
4. Embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers
5. Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database
6. On user query:
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved via similarity search
   - Chunks are passed to FLAN-T5 as context
   - Answer is generated and displayed in the chat UI

---

## UI Features

- Chat-style interface
- User messages displayed on the right
- AI responses displayed on the left
- Context and Answer shown separately
- Scrollable chat window

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/offline-rag-ai-assistant.git
cd offline-rag-ai-assistant
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the backend server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 5. Open the frontend

```bash
xdg-open frontend/index.html
```
